# Regional Governance

- Each country should be subdivided into smaller regions.
- Each region should contain approximately 35,000 people, similar to the population of Magarpatta City in Pune, Maharashtra, India.
- Every year, voters in each region should elect a regional leader through ranked voting ([ranked-choice voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting)).
- Voting should be compulsory, and each voter should provide a brief explanation for why they ranked each candidate as they did.
- Voters should also elect the following key officials. They should be the most honest of all people in the country:
  - A national leader responsible for the military, inter-regional infrastructure, and foreign policy.
  - A law official responsible for overseeing national laws and legal systems.
  - An auditor or comptroller to ensure financial transparency.
  - A media official responsible for ensuring the dissemination of fair and accurate news.
  - An election official responsible for maintaining the integrity of elections.
- The majority of taxes paid by citizens should be allocated to the regional administration, managed by the elected regional leader.
- A smaller portion of the taxes should fund the five national officials mentioned above.
- Each region should independently manage its own laws, police, schools, hospitals, and other public services, funded through regional tax revenues.
- Each national official and regional leader can appoint their own team.
